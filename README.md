# Daowakanda Dev Task

This dev task requires you to call the 'claimAsset' method of an existing smart contract using the Application Spec in `src/client.ts`;
For reference, see this example: https://github.com/Algorand-Africa/peer-coding-session-1/blob/main/client/src/index.ts

To compile and run, run this command: `npm run development`

In order to sucessfully call the 'claimAsset' method, you must ensure that you're opted into the ASA whose id is assigned to the global state whose key is 'asset', and you must pass a minimum fee of 6000 micro algos to the method call transaction.
The app id can be found in the `src/index.ts` file.

To complete this dev task, you must create a fork of the repository and commit your answer. A link to your fork should be
submitted on DaoWakanda.

Ensure that you do not push your mnemonic key to GitHub. Add your address to the `src/index.ts` file as a comment as the address can be used to confirm that you successfully claimed the ASA.
